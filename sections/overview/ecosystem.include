## Ecosystem Overview ## {#sctn-ecosystem-overview}

Accountable Digital Identity Architecture (<dfn>ADIA</dfn>) is a decentralized network of networks integrating Regional Directories, Interchanges, Issuers, Service Providers and Users with unique Trust Anchors. All entities within the architecture are represented by DIDs.
Each DID is resolvable to a DID Document which contains cryptographic keys and service endpoints as specified in the DID Core Specification.

The focus of the ecosystem is to:
* provide a look up at the time of initial onboarding to make sure there are no duplications of identity
* provide the trust framework and a source of truth to facilitate accountability in the event of fraud
* facilitate value settlements across different identity Systems

The ecosystem consists of entities that are involved in the trust framework. They are:

* <a>ADIA Global Directory</a> (AGD): One primary Root of Trust system with one or more distributed or delegated shared instances.
* <a>ADIA Regional Directory</a> (ARD): One or more Directory Services serving a scope, such as a geopolitical region or a country. Each directory serves to uniquely identify each participant via a <a>Digital Address</a> or a collection of attributes.
* <a>Interchange</a>: A composition of services providing foundational functionality such as <a>Digital Address Service</a>, Identity Escrow, Credential Broker, and Payment Broker for the entities in the ecosystem.
* <a>Digital Address Service</a> (<a>DAS</a>): An agency providing services to entities within its domain. All interactions between entities are facilitated through agents and services provided by the agency.
* <a>Issuer</a>: An entity representing both Identity (e.g., DMV, Passport Office, etc.) or Non-Identity Credential Issuers (e.g., University, Enterprise, Healthcare Provider, etc.)
* <a>Service Provider</a>: One or more service providers acting as relying parties. E.g., E-commerce site, Retailer, etc.
* <a>User</a>: Holder and usually Subject of a <a>Digital Address</a> - one per human identity in a region.

These entities and their role in the ADIA ecosystem are described in [[#sctn-roles-in-adia]].

## Trust Anchor ## {#sctn-trust-anchor}

<dfn export="true">Trust Anchor</dfn> (<dfn>TA</dfn>) is a unique identifier for a given entity in the ADIA ecosystem and is registered in an ADIA Directory.
A Trust Anchor uniquely maps an entity's <a>Digital Address</a> and a DAS-assigned DID.

The ADIA Directories (<a>AGD</a> and <a>ARD</a>s), for regulatory purposes and user privacy, do not store any personal information about a user or an entity.
Directories support a userâ€™s right to be forgotten that is defined in many jurisdictions.

Directories MAY use a Universally Unique Identifier (<dfn>UUID</dfn>), a Globally Unique Identifier (<dfn>GUID</dfn>)
    as specified by [[!RFC4122]] or an opaque 128-character random character string to represent the Trust Anchor.


## Digital Address ## {#sctn-digital-address}

DIDs are the foundational identifiers of the system but are not participant friendly. The <dfn>Digital Address</dfn> is a special ADIA identifier issued to an individual by a certified Digital Address Issuer after Know Your Customer (KYC) processes have been followed. <a>Digital Address</a>es are designed to be human friendly and facilitate interaction with entities. When they present their Digital Address to a participating service, the service can contact the directory and receive a DID that represents the participant.
Further communication and cryptographic trust are then founded on the provided DID. <a>Digital Address</a>es contain a DAS indicator that can be used to identify which DAS is the Home DAS of the Digital Address.

The creation of a <a>Digital Address</a> is a crucial step in ensuring there is both trust and accountability within the ADIA ecosystem. Digital Address Issuers could be financial service providers, government agencies, education providers and enterprises; organizations that are central to the trust economy.
To prevent the <a>Digital Address</a> from being misused as a correlating identifier, <a>Digital Address</a>es must not be retained by
participating <a>Service Provider</a>s after resolution.
Their role is specifically limited to facilitating the participant-onboarding processes.


### Uniqueness ### {#sctn-digital-address-uniqueness}

Entities in ADIA shall not have more than one <a>Digital Address</a>. To ensure this uniqueness, the identity-related traits for a user are verified and hashed by an <a>Issuer Agent</a>.
This specification defines the attributes for all entities to create a <a>HIDA</a>, a cryptographic hash computed over the identifying attributes, such as:

* Name of the User or Entity in the identifying document
* Country, the type of document, a valid identifier on the identifying document
* Dates such as Birth date or Date of Incorporation for the User or Entity

The <a>HIDA</a> is used to query the Directory to determine uniqueness of the User or Entity based on the identity attributes provided.
The process of binding the <a>Digital Address</a> with the Trust Anchor notifying the user is described in [[#sctn-onboarding-1st-issuer]]

Please see [[#sctn-hida-computation]] details for users and other Entities.

### Format ### {#sctn-digital-address-format-overview}

The <a>Digital Address</a> is a user friendly mnemonic that maps to a technical identifier, the DID for the user or Entity. Participants
may change their <a>Digital Address</a> at a later point in time.

The format is specified as follows:
<code>
  <Alphanumeric>@HomeDASIdentifier
</code>

Please see [[#sctn-digital-address-format]] for the format for Users and Entities.
