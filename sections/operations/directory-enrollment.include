### Enroll a Regional Directory ### {#sctn-enroll-as-ADIA-regional}

Regional Directories are onboarded into the <a>ADIA</a> Ecosystem by the <a>ADIA Global Directory</a>. The process starts with the Regional Directory
providing their organizational and contact person details to meet the certification criteria established by the ADIA Governance process.

The governing body within the <a>ADIA Global Directory</a> may approve or reject requests to enroll into the <a>ADIA</a> ecosystem.
On successful approval of an Entity as a Regional Directory, a provisioning request is sent to the responsible party within
the Regional Directory. The process to set up an Agent is beyond the scope of this document but is a necessary
prerequisite to enroll the ADIA Regional Agent (ARD Agent).

An ARD Agent generates the public/private key pair for the Entity and requests a Digital Address to be created by the <a>ADIA Global Directory</a> (AGD Agent).
A <a>DIDDoc</a> for the ARD with its endpoint details, public keys and any additional information is published to the <a>ADIA Global Directory</a>.

Enrollment into the <a>ADIA Global Directory</a> is complete when the <a>ARD_ID</a> to the Hashed ID attributes (<a>HIDA</a>) of the entity are
related in the <a>ADIA Global Directory</a>.
A <a>VC</a> is issued by the <a>AGD</a> using information used to verify the <a>ARD</a>.

The following sequence diagram depicts the details of the flow between entities and exchange of messages between Agents.

Note: Details of the Agents and protocol messages are depicted below.

### Enroll a DAS ### {#sctn-enroll-as-das}

<a>Digital Address Service</a>s (<a>DAS</a>s) are onboarded into the <a>ADIA</a> Ecosystem by the <a>ADIA Regional Directory</a>. The process starts with the <a>DAS</a>
providing their organizational and contact person details to meet the certification criteria established by the ADIA Governance process.

The governing body within the <a>ADIA Regional Directory</a> may approve or reject requests to enroll into the <a>ADIA</a> ecosystem.
On successful approval of an Entity as a <a>DAS</a>, provisioning request is sent to the responsible party at the DAS. The process to set up an
Agent is beyond the scope of this document but is a necessary prerequisite to enroll the <a>DAS Agent</a> to the <a>ADIA Regional Directory</a>.

A <a>DAS Agent</a> generates the public/private key pair for the Entity and requests a <a>Digital Address</a> to be created
by the <a>ADIA Regional Directory</a> (ARD Agent).
A <a>DIDDoc</a> for the DAS with endpoint details, public keys and any additional information is published to the <a>ADIA Global Directory</a>.

Enrollment into <a>ADIA Global Directory</a> is complete when the <a>DAS_ID</a> to the Hashed ID attributes (<a>HIDA</a>) of the entity are related in the <a>ADIA Global Directory</a>.
A <a>VC</a> is issued by the <a>ARD</a> using information used to verify the <a>DAS</a>.

The following sequence diagram depicts the details of the flow between entities and exchange of messages between agents.

Note: Details of the agents and protocol messages are depicted below.

### Enroll an Issuer ### {#sctn-enroll-as-issuer}

Issuers are onboarded into the <a>ADIA</a> Ecosystem by a <a>DAS</a>. The process starts with the <a>DAS</a> requiring the
prospective <a>Issuer</a> to provide organizational details, a contact person for the organization and details to qualify the
<a>Issuer</a> as a member in good business standing, financial status and criteria to meet the Certification process established
by the ADIA Governance policies.

The governing body within the <a>DAS</a> may approve or reject requests to enroll into the <a>DAS</a> and the <a>ADIA</a>
ecosystem. Successful approval of an Entity as an <a>Issuer</a> results in a <a>Digital Address</a> and a <a>DID</a> (i.e. <a>ISSUER_ID</a>) being created.
A <a>VC</a> is issued by the <a>DAS</a> using information used to verify the <a>Issuer</a>.
The <a>DAS</a> may also enforce additional policies to ensure that the <a>Issuer</a> can issue <a>Digital Address</a>es to <a>Users</a> or
issue <a>Verifiable Credentials</a> with a certain <a>Assurance Level</a>.
Please see [[#sctn-assurance-level]] for more detail.

In certain deployment models, a <a>DAS</a> may provide the <a>Issuer</a> with an <a>Issuer Agent</a> and a <a>VC Store</a>
that comply to the ADIA Specification. Other deployments may provide agency services to provision the <a>Issuer Agent</a>s in a hosted model.

Regardless the variances in the deployment model, the <a>Issuer Agent</a> is responsible for creating and managing their private key (<a>ISSUER_ID_SK</a>)
and <a>DID</a> (i.e. <a>ISSUER_ID</a>) and enroll with the <a>DAS</a>. The <a>Issuer</a>'s public information such as business name and the <a>DIDDoc-Issuer</a>
is published to the <a>ADIA Global Directory</a> for lookups by any entity in the <a>ADIA</a> ecosystem.

### Enroll a Service Provider ### {#sctn-enroll-as-serviceprovider}

Service Providers are onboarded into the ADIA Ecosystem by a <a>DAS</a>. The process starts with the <a>DAS</a> requiring the
prospective <a>Service Provider</a> to provide organizational details, a contact person for the organization and details to join the ecosystem.

The governing body within <a>DAS</a> may approve or reject requests to enroll into the <a>DAS</a> and the <a>ADIA</a> ecosystem.
Successful approval of an Entity as an <a>Service Provider</a> results in a <a>Digital Address</a> and a <a>DID</a> (i.e. <a>SP_ID</a>) being created.
A <a>VC</a> is issued by the <a>DAS</a> using information used to verify the <a>Service Provider</a>.

The <a>DAS</a> may provide API services or provide agency services to provision the <a>Service Provider Agent</a> in a hosted model to request
and verify <a>Verifiable Credential</a>s of <a>User</a>s.

Agent based deployments may require the <a>Service Provider</a> to manage their private key (<a>SP_ID_SK</a>) and <a>DID</a> (i.e. <a>SP_ID</a>)
and enroll with the <a>DAS</a>. The <a>Service Provider</a>'s public information such as business name and their <a>DIDDoc-SP</a> is published to
the <a>ADIA Global Directory</a> for lookups by any entity in the <a>ADIA</a> ecosystem.

### Enroll a User ### {#sctn-enroll-user}

Users may approach <a>Issuer</a>s to create a <a>Digital Address</a> or <a>Issuer</a>s may create a <a>Digital Address</a> for a user prior
to issuing a <a>Verifiable Credential</a> to that <a>User</a>.
Creating a <a>Digital Address</a> starts with the issuer collecting identity attributes of the <a>User</a> and checking
the <a>HIDA</a> resulting from the <a>HIDA</a> hashing process against the
existing <a>HIDA</a> registry to see if the <a>User</a> is already `known` to the system.

A lookup of the <a>HIDA</a> may result in the possibility of an existing <a>Digital Address</a> for that <a>User</a>. The <a>User</a> may request
to link the existing <a>Digital Address</a> instead of creating a new one. ADIA Governance policies and technical constraints
within this specification enforce that the uniqueness of the <a>HIDA</a> for a given <a>User</a> is
maintained within the same <a>ADIA Regional Directory</a>.

The <a>DAS</a> related to the first <a>Digital Address</a> provided by an <a>Issuer</a> is called <a>HomeDAS</a>. The <a>HomeDAS</a> also
provides services to persist and search the <a>Credential Metadata</a> associated with the <a>Verifiable Credential</a>s issued to the <a>User</a>.


#### Issuer Initiated New User Enrollment #### {#sctn-onboarding-1st-issuer}

The diagram below represents a `new` <a>User</a> requesting a <a>Digital Address</a> from an <a>Issuer</a>.
The <a>DAS</a> providing the Agency services, provisions a <a>Cloud Agent</a> for the <a>User</a> to create
a public/private key pair and a <a>DID</a> (i.e. <a>DAS_usER_ID</a>) for the <a>User</a>. The identifier (<a>DAS_USER_ID</a>), along with the
<a>HomeDAS</a> identifier (<a>HomeDAS_ID</a>) are persisted on the <a>DAS</a> to associate their identifiers with the newly created <a>Digital Address</a>.
Please refer to the [[#sctn-trust-anchor]] and [[#sctn-digital-address]] sections for more details on the representation and usage of the <a>Digital Address</a>.

The <a>Issuer</a> may share the <a>Digital Address</a> with the <a>User</a> through any secure channel. For simplicity, the diagram
shows the sharing of <a>Digital Address</a> information encoded in a QR code that can be scanned using the <a>DAA</a> or
another method endorsed by this <a>ADIA</a> Specification.

<figure id="fig-onboarding-1st-issuer">
    <img src="sequence-diagrams/User-onboarding-to-first-issuer.svg">
    <figcaption>User Onboarding to First Issuer</figcaption>
</figure>

There are some important steps before the <a>User</a> is allowed to import the <a>Digital Address</a>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Verifying the <a>User</a>'s Identity</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The <a>DAA</a> may enforce ID Proofing using the same identity document used during the <a>Digital Address</a> creation. The
    ID attributes are sent to the <a>Issuer</a> of the <a>DA</a> for verification</li>
    <li>The <a>Issuer</a> may provide an in-person verification service to manually verify the <a>User</a>'s identity.
    Please see [[#sctn-verify-user-da-in-person]].
  </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Authenticate the <a>User</a> given the <a>Digital Address</a></strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The <a>DAS</a> may request the <a>User</a> to register their <a>DAA</a> using FIDO. FIDO provides a
     strong passwordless authentication for operations such as resenting proof or other operations that require the <a>User</a>'s
     consent using a biometric or possession based verification mechanism before unlocking the private key for signing functions. Please
    see the section on [[#sctn-adia-role-daa]] for more details.
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>User Consent</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The process of importing the <a>Digital Address</a> is complete when the <a>User</a> consents to its import.
    Please see the section on [[#sctn-user-consents]] for details.
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

</ol>

Once a <a>Digital Address</a> is acquired by the <a>User</a>, possible subsequent steps are:
* The <a>User</a> may choose to recover their forgotten <a>Digital Address</a> using approved methods. Please see sections on [[#sctn-recover-digital-address]] or [[#sctn-da-delegated-recovery]].
* The <a>User</a> may disenroll from the ADIA ecosystem. Please see section on the [[#sctn-user-account-deletion]] for details.


#### Enroll a User with existing Digital Address #### {#sctn-onboarding-2nd-issuer}

A <a>User</a> with an existing <a>Digital Address</a>, intentionally or unintentionally may request another <a>Digital Address</a>.
The request may be initiated by an <a>Issuer</a> on the same <a>DAS</a> or an <a>Issuer</a> on another <a>DAS</a> within the
same <a>ADIA Regional Directory</a>.
Within a single <a>ADIA Regional Directory</a>, if the <a>HIDA</a> for the <a>User</a> results in a collision, the <a>User</a> may not
request a new <a>Digital Address</a> but instead is notified of the existing one.

<figure id="fig-onboarding-2nd-issuer">
    <img src="sequence-diagrams/User-onboarding-to-second-issuer.svg">
    <figcaption>User Onboarding to Second Issuer</figcaption>
</figure>

Note: It is possible for a <a>User</a> to have a different <a>Digital Address</a> in another <a>ADIA Regional Directory</a>.

#### User Initiated New User Enrollment (using DAA) #### {#sctn-user-initiated-da-with-daa}

A <a>User</a> may initiate the creation of a <a>Digital Address</a> remotely, via an online service
provided by a <a>Digital Address</a> <a>Issuer</a>. The <a>Issuer</a>'s service must follow procedures similar to the
in-person creation by requesting the identity attributes of the <a>User</a>, generating the hashed attributes (<a>HIDA</a>) and verifying against
the <a>ADIA Regional Directory</a>.

The online service of the <a>Issuer</a> presents the user with a QR code either online on its website or offline via an email or alternate service channel,
such that the <a>User</a> is able to scan the QR code containing their <a>Digital Address</a> information and initiate an Authenticator Binding processes
with the <a>HomeDAS</a>.

<figure id="fig-user-initiated-da">
    <img src="sequence-diagrams/User-initiated-DA-with-daa.svg">
    <figcaption>User Initiated Digital Address Creation with DAA</figcaption>
</figure>

A successful authentication and binding to the <a>HomeDAS</a>'s services allows the user to use the <a>Digital Address</a>
at the <a>Assurance Level</a> determined by the onboarding process. Please see the section on [[#sctn-assurance-level]] for more information.

Though it may be adequate for some purposes, some <a>Service Provider</a>s in the ecosystem may require the
<a>User</a> to have a higher <a>Assurance Level</a>. <a>Issuer</a>'s in ADIA may provide verification services for <a>Users</a> to upgrade their
<a>Assurance Level</a> assigned by remote methods. This is described in the section [[#sctn-verify-user-da-in-person]].


#### Issuer Assisted Verification of Digital Address #### {#sctn-verify-user-da-in-person}

The <a>User</a> may choose to visit a Verification Center in person to upgrade the <a>Assurance Level</a>
initially assigned by the system. An in-person verification may include a manual review and verification
of their identity documents by a certified operator before reporting to the <a>DAS</a> about the genuineness of the subject.

The <a>DAS</a> may independently request the <a>User</a> to authenticate before upgrading the <a>User</a>'s <a>Assurance Level</a>.
