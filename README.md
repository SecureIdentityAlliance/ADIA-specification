GitHub Desktop:
Github Desktop is a GUI interface for git operations.  It can be used instead of command line git commands for people who prefer that.
Link to download: https://desktop.github.com/
There is an installation wizard that will guide you to connect GitHub Desktop to GitHub online and you will be able to create a copy of the spec repository on your local machine.
