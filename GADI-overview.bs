# Introduction # {#sctn-intro}
This specification provides a overview of the GADI system.


# Entities # {#sctn-entities}

<dl>
    : <dfn>Cloud Agent</dfn>
    :: A cloud accessible entity that acts on behalf of the user. It has some similarity to the
         eIDAS Trust Service Providers (https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/trust-services).

    : <dfn>DA</dfn>
    :: Human readabe Digital Address of the <a>User</a> (e.g. john.doe@issuer.dap.gadi.org).

    : <dfn>DAP_USER_ID</dfn>
    :: The DAP specific Decentralized Identifier (DID) related to the <a>DA</a>, e.g. did:example:123456789abcdefghi

    :  <dfn>DAP_USER_ID_PK</dfn>, <dfn>DAP_USER_ID_SK</dfn>
    :: Public Key (PK) and Private Key (SK) related to the <a>DAP_USER_ID</a>.

    :  <dfn>DAA</dfn>
    :: Digital Address Application, e.g. Android App or iOS App that knows how to talk to the DAP on behalf of the <a>User</a>.

    :  <dfn>DAP</dfn>
    :: Digital Address Provider.

    :  <dfn>DAP_ID</dfn>
    :: DAP IDentity, i.e. the W3C DID style identifier for the <a>DAP</a>.

    :  <dfn>DAP_ID_PK</dfn>, <dfn>DAP_IS_SK</dfn>
    :: Public Key (PK) and Private Key (SK) related to the <a>DAP_ID</a>.

    : <dfn>DID</dfn>
    :: Decentralized Identifier according to [[!did-core]]

    :  <dfn>HIDA</dfn>
    :: Cryptographic hash computed over the <a>ID Attributes</a>

    :  <dfn>HomeDAP_ID</dfn>
    :: DAP_ID of the DAP that user primarliy belongs to.

    :  <dfn>ID Attributes</dfn>
    :: Attributes identifying a user uniquely, i.e. firstname, last name, date of birth, country of birth, city of birth.

    :  <dfn>Issuer</dfn>
    :: Issuer of <a>VC</a>s to users.  GADI supports multiple Issuers per <a>User</a>.

    :  <dfn>ISSUER_ID</dfn>
    :: Issuer IDentity, i.e. the <a>DID</a> style identifier for the <a>Issuer</a>.

    :  <dfn>ISSUER_ID_PK</dfn>, <dfn>ISSUER_IS_SK</dfn>
    :: Public Key (PK) and Private Key (SK) related to the <a>ISSUER_ID</a>.

    :  <dfn>SP</dfn>
    :: Service Provider that verifies <a>VC</a>s.

    :  <dfn>SP_ID</dfn>
    :: Service Provider IDentity, i.e. the <a>DID</a> style identifier for the <a>SP</a>.

    :  <dfn>SP_ID_PK</dfn>, <dfn>SP_IS_SK</dfn>
    :: Public Key (PK) and Private Key (SK) related to the <a>SP_ID</a>.

    : <dfn>TA</dfn>
    :: <dfn>Trust Anchor</dfn>, i.e. a randomly generated number related to a User. E.g. 3456893265abf...849287c.


Issue: Why do we need the TA?  It doesn't directly appear in any sequence diagram so far.


    :  <dfn>TA_USER_ISSUER</dfn>
    :: The <a>Issuer</a> specific <a>TA</a>, i.e. hash(<a>TA</a>, <a>ISSUER_ID</a>).

	      If two SPs both received a credential that John Doe was born on date X in Y,
	      then the two SPs could learn it is the very likely same user. But this has nothing to do with GADI.

	      As a consequence, the Digital Address / TrustAnchor are NOT part of the credential.

Issue: Although I agree with this goal, so much of our system depends on <a>Issuer</a>s and the GADI registry to prevent duplicates. The GADI registry is permissioned, and only valid issuers can access. I'm not sure how this will work without an issuer -- possible risk of adversary obtaining information by trying to create identities and seeing if a digital address already exists for certain PII data. Let's discuss

	      and the user will be able to present this human readable, typable, or presentable to the issuers to be able to
	      push the credentials for the user.   This is just between users and <a>Issuer</a>s.  We however can also provide
	      different handles (Different Digital Addresses) that can be orchestrated between the user Device and <a>DAP</a> to
	      present to different issuers if we need to also make DA one time as the issued credential is a <a>DID</a>.

# GADI Operations # {#sctn-ops}


## User Onboarding to First Issuer ## {#sctn-onboarding-1st-issuer}

    <img src="sequence-diagrams/User-onboarding-to-first-issuer.svg"/>
    <figcaption>User Onboarding to First Issuer</figcaption>
</figure>

Note: HIDA is PII and might need to be erased on account deletion (see User DAP Account Deletion)

Issue: The <a>Issuer</a> remembers the DA. Wouldn't the issuer want to remember DAP_USER_ID as well?  It is needed when issuing a VC.

Issue: Check DAP_USER_ID_PK/SK generation. Would we store the PK in Home-DAP or GADI??  When will that key be created and by Whom?


## Verifiable Credential Issuance ## {#sctn-vc-issuance-1}

<figure id="fig-vc-issuance-option-1">
    <img src="sequence-diagrams/VC-Issuance-Option-1.svg"/>
    <figcaption>Verifiable Credential Issuance (Option 1)</figcaption>
</figure>

Issue: Looking up DAP_USER_ID by DA, requires DAP to have remembered DA and related DAP_USER_ID.
  But DA isn't remembered yet. DA is PII and likely even PI.
  <a>Issuer</a>s have access to HIDA and hence could ask GADI via DAP to lookup TA_USER_ISSUER by HIDA.

Issue: Explain what "Invite the Cloud  Agent for DIDcomm conn" mean in detail, i.e. which keys are involved, what kind of encryption/integrity protection method is used, any channel binding?, etc. [[!didcomm-messaging]].


## Verifiable Credential Presentation and Verification ## {#sctn-vc-presentation-and-verification-1}

Goal of this operation is to provide some identity attributes related to the user with the Service Provider (SP).
  These attributes are include in the <a>verifiable credential</a> and have been verified by the <a>Issuer</a>.
  We always use <dfn>Verifiable Presentations</dfn> as defined by [[!vc-data-model]] (https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-presentations).

We distinguish 2 different types of <a>verifiable credential</a>s:
1. Credentials that include sufficient personal identifiable information to uniquely identify the user and
2. Credentials that don't. For example just stating that the user is older than 21.

In both cases, a public key is typically included in the <a>verifiable credential</a>.
  It is used as a proxy for the user, meaning anyone that can proof access of the related private key is assumed to be the user.
  Consequently, in case (2), the public key - if it is included - will never appear publicly with a link to the user record. Instead, it will be a
  temporary use key, that is included in order to allow the SP to detect which subject the attributes relate to.

    <img src="sequence-diagrams/VC-Presentation-and-Verification-Option-1.svg"/>
    <figcaption>Verifiable Presentation and Verification (Option 1)</figcaption>
</figure>

Issue: For an anonymous verifiable presentation, we need to run some "join" protocol between the <a>DAA</a> and/or <a>Cloud Agent</a> and the DAP/GADI system.

Issue: Having the <a>DAA</a> authenticate with FIDO to <a>Cloud Agent</a> either requires second FIDO credential (tied to <a>Cloud Agent</a>) or it requires the <a>Cloud Agent</a> to allow use of the DAP related FIDO credential

Issue: Describe, how the SP can verify whether an ISSUER_ID_PK is trustworthy or not (introduced through the DAP).  And in the next step how to verify whether DAP_ID_PK is trustworthy or not.


## User Onboarding Attempt to 2nd Issuer ## {#sctn-onboarding-2nd-issuer}

<figure id="fig-onboarding-2nd-issuer">
    <img src="sequence-diagrams/User-onboarding-to-second-issuer.svg"/>
    <figcaption>User Onboarding to Second Issuer</figcaption>
</figure>


## User DAP Account Deletion ## {#sctn-user-dap-account-deletion}

<figure id="fig-user-dap-account-deletion">
    <img src="sequence-diagrams/User-DAP-Account-Deletion.svg"/>
    <figcaption>User DAP Account Deletion</figcaption>
</figure>

Issue: <a>Cloud Agent</a> needs to be added - it maintains cryptographic keys on behalf on the user

Issue: Is it expected that <a>Issuer</a> relations are not deleted?  Maybe DAP Account deletion should be just a part of <a>Issuer</a> account deletion?

Issue: Do we need an issuer-triggered account deletion function as well?

Issue: Is it expected that VCs are not deleted?

Issue: How could a user without a working <a>DAA</a> instance trigger account deletion?


## User Bootstraps New DAA Instance "Lost Phone" ## {#sctn-user-bootstraps-new-daa-instance-1}

<figure id="fig-user-bootstraps-new-daa-instance">
    <img src="sequence-diagrams/User-bootstrap-new-DAA-instance.svg"/>
    <figcaption>User Bootstraps New DAA Instance "Lost Phone"</figcaption>
</figure>

Issue: requiring ID Proofing looks expensive here. Are there methods without that (that provide a similar security level)?

Issue: Do we want DAP to perform the ID proofing - not the <a>Issuer</a>?
